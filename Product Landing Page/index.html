            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Students interested in computer programming may earn an associate's or bachelor's degree in a field such as computer science, information technology, computer information systems or management information systems. Earning an associate's degree prepares students for employment in computer programming; it also prepares students to transfer to a bachelor's degree program in computer science at a 4-year college or university.Computer programming courses focus on helping students develop an understanding of computer networks, operating systems, algorithms, database systems and web design. Students in computer programming courses will become familiar with programming languages such as HTML and CSS.Here is a list of topics commonly explored in computer programming courses:

                <h3>6 months <span>(Hover here for more information)</span></h3>
                <p>In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. </p>

                <h3>8 months<span>(Hover here for more information)</span></h3>
                <p>Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java—one of the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.</p>

                <p>The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and React. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Ideally learners should complete the courses in the specified sequence. </p>
